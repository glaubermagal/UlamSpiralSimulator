This is the fastest simulator of Ulam Spiral because it use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to calculate the primes and because all calculus are done without manipulating the DOM tree. After all calculus are finished, the points are printed in a canvas element.

You can set the size of the dots, the distance between them, their colors and set the spiral will fill the window.
